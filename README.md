# 🤖 HomeBuddy — Frontend Application

A **production‑grade frontend application** for a home assistant robot platform, designed with **clarity, reliability, and human‑centric UX** at its core.

This repository focuses on the **frontend system** — the user interface layer that connects people to a real, live robotic and healthcare‑oriented platform.

The application is fully deployed and can be explored live.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://home-buddy-v2.vercel.app/

## 🌟 Frontend Vision

HomeBuddy’s frontend is designed around three real user contexts:

- 👵 **Elderly users** who need calm visuals, large touch targets, and confidence in every action  
- 👨‍⚕️ **Caregivers & administrators** who need visibility, control, and predictable workflows  
- 🤖 **A physical robot system**, where UI decisions must reflect real‑world behavior  

Every screen, component, and interaction is intentional and purpose‑driven.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Calm interfaces** → soft color palettes, low visual noise, stable layouts  
- **Predictable interactions** → consistent spacing, familiar patterns, no surprises  
- **Accessibility‑aware UI** → readable typography, forgiving interactions, clear feedback  
- **Human‑centered language** → friendly wording over technical jargon  

The goal is not visual flash — it is **clarity, trust, and usability**.
